to dear me, Taters;

your openfoam is installed at /usr/lib/openfoam/openfoam2506
you wanna run that bashrc located inside the etc folder before running terminal commands (..../openfoam2506/etc/bashrc)
and you do that by "source <bashrc_file_here>"

you decided to use cfMesh instead of snappyHexMesh

Meshing tools:
- cartesianMesh -> creates mesh using hex things
- checkMesh    -> does a check??
- checkSurfaceMesh -> performs basic topology and geometric checks on input surface mesh
- improveMeshQuality   -> applies a smoother to the mesh in order to improve overall quality, number of parameters is controllable via optional parameters
- surfaceToFMS -> converts a common surface triangulation (stl) into fms format
- surfaceFeatureEdges <input> <output> -angle <sFE_angle>  -> used for extracting feature edges (sharp angles). if output is a fms file, the extracted edges are stored as feature edges. otherwise generates patches bounded by the selected feature edges
- surfaceGenerateBoundingBox <input stl file> <output stl file> xNeg xPos yNeg yPos zNeg zPos -> does the bounding box for boundary surfaces

Have fun and keep rollin around
Yours truly, Taters
